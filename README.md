### What is HTML?

HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is a markup language which describes the structure of web pages. Web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome, interpret the HTML code and use it to render some output. HTML doesn't have any logic behind it, like Ruby and other programming languages. Instead, it simply surrounds content and tells web browsers how that content should be displayed. 

### HTML Syntax

HTML consists of different elements, which consist of opening and closing tags. For example, say we had the content `Hello World` that we wanted to display as a separate paragraph. We could use the `p` element, which consists of an opening `p` tag and a closing `p` tag.

<p>Hello World</p>

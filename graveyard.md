For millennia humans have sought ever-more (1) replicatable and (2) durable
ways to communicate. _Replicatable_ means that many editions can be created in
a cost-effective manner. da Vinci's _La Gioconda_ is **not** replicatable and,
like most masterpieces, is therefore "unique" &mdash; the antonym to
"replicatable."  _Durable_ means that a thing will endure across time. A
Tibetan sand mandala is not durable while an Egyptian obelisk is. There is
generally a push-pull relationship between cost, durability, and
replicatability that merits some philosophical consideration.

As forms of communication, the Pyramids of Giza are highly _durable_: we know
something about the attitudes and beliefs of humans of 5 millennia ago &mdash;
but communications of this level of durability are awfully hard to duplicate.
We can more cheaply achive durability by creating multiple copies (provided we
can do it cheaply enough).  Books hot off a printing press are duplicated with
industrial efficiency, but they're vulnerable to fire, fashion, water, and
censors.

In the pre-Web era, the Internet offered a solution: text files could be
duplicated quickly from a host computer (a "server") to _your own computer_ (a
"client"). Through ease and speed of data transfer data could be _replicated_
in many places and therefore become _durable_.
